    <string name="aboutChhotaUdepur">The district consists of the six talukas of Chhota Udepur,
                Pavi Jetpur, Kawant, Naswadi, Sankheda and the newly created Bodeli taluka.
                The district headquarters is located at Chhota Udepur.
                The district was created to facilitate decentralisation and ease of access to government services.
                Its creation, announced in the run up to the Assembly elections in Gujarat in 2012,
                was also seen by the media and political analysts as a government strategy to attract tribal votes.
                Chhota Udaipur is a tribal dominated district and the district headquarters is located 110 km away
                from Vadodara. It shares its borders with the state of Madhya Pradesh.
                Chhota Udepur is the third tribal dominated district in eastern Gujarat after the Narmada and Tapi districts.
                Chhota Udepur district has a forest area of 75,704 hectares and has deposits of dolomite,
                fluorite, granite and sand all of which are mined. The district is also home to a large dairy industry.
                The Rathwa tribals who live here produce the Pithora mural paintings by mixing colours with liquour
                and milk and then using it to depict intricate motifs and scenes on the walls of their village dwellings.</string>
